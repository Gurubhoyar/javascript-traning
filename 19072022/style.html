        JavaScript is a programming language commonly used in web development. It was originally developed by Netscape
        as a means to add dynamic and interactive elements to websites. While JavaScript is influenced by Java, the
        syntax is more similar to C and is based on ECMAScript, a scripting language developed by Sun Microsystems.
